## ⚖️ Why Run OpenCode in Docker?

### ✨ The Advantages

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🛡️ **Isolation** | No dependencies pollute your host machine |
| 🔄 **Consistency** | Same environment across all users and contributors |
| 🔒 **Security** | Sandboxed environment that is easy to revoke |
| 📌 **Version Control** | Pin specific OpenCode versions with ease |
| 💻 **Cross-Platform** | Works identically on Windows, Mac, and Linux |
| 🧹 **Clean State** | Start fresh every time, no accumulated junk |

### ⚠️ The Trade-offs

| Limitation | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 📁 **File Access** | Only files in mounted directories are accessible |
| ⚡ **Performance** | Slight overhead compared to native execution |
| 🐳 **Docker Required** | Must have Docker installed and running |
| 🖥️ **No GUI Apps** | Strictly a terminal-only interface |
| 📈 **Resource Usage** | Consumes memory/CPU for container runtime |

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Visual Studio Code
* Docker Desktop / Engine
* GitHub Account

### 1. Clone and Open

```bash
git clone https://github.com/2241812/OpenCode-VSCode-Setup.git
cd OpenCode-VSCode-Setup
code .
```

### 2. Open in Container

Install the **Dev Containers** extension (published by Microsoft):

1. Open VSCode Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Search for "Dev Containers"
3. Click **Install**

> **Note:** The extension is called "Dev Containers" in VSCode, but uses the command "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" (formerly "Remote-Containers" in older versions).

After installing:

1. Press `F1` and select **"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"**
2. Or click the `><` icon in the bottom-left corner → **"Reopen in Container"**
3. Wait for the container to build (this happens automatically from the Dockerfile)

> **VSCode Prompt:** When you open the folder, VSCode may ask "Add Dev Container Configuration Files?" - just click **"Add to workspace"** (or "Don't prompt again") and it will use the existing `.devcontainer/` config in the repo.
>
> **Container Source Prompt:** If VSCode then asks "Select how to define the development container", choose **"From Dockerfile"** (the repo already has both `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and `Dockerfile` configured). The devcontainer.json is set up to use the Dockerfile in the project root.
>
> **Features Prompt:** VSCode may then ask "Select additional features to install" - you can just click **"OK"** (or select "None") since the Dockerfile already includes everything needed.
>
> **Optional Files Prompt:** VSCode may ask about `.github/dependabot.yml` or other optional files - just click **"OK"** to proceed with defaults.

### 3. Run OpenCode

Open the integrated terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``) and use the session manager:

> **Note:** The `run` script is installed to `/usr/local/bin/` inside the container, so it's available in your PATH. Use `run` (without `./`) from any directory.

```bash
# Start a new session
run new

# Or start a named session
run new my-feature

# Or resume a previous session
run list        # See all saved sessions
run resume <name>
```

That's it! OpenCode is pre-installed and ready to go.

## 🏗️ How It Works

The Dockerfile sets up a complete OpenCode environment:

| Step | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| 1 | Creates `devuser` - a non-root user for security |
| 2 | Pre-creates config directories (`~/.config/opencode`, `~/.local/share/opencode`, `~/.ssh`) |
| 3 | Installs OpenCode via the official install script |
| 4 | Sets up PATH to include OpenCode binaries |

When you use VS Code Remote Containers, everything is pre-configured - just clone and run `opencode`.

## 🛠️ Configuration & Setup

### Connect an AI Provider

Before using OpenCode, you need to connect an AI provider:

```bash
opencode
/init
```

Then run `/connect` to add your API key. Or set environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

### VSCode Remote Containers

**What is it?**

Remote Containers lets you open any folder inside a Docker container as your workspace in VSCode. Your entire development environment—including OpenCode—runs securely inside the container.

**Benefits:**
- **Seamless integration:** Terminals, extensions, and the file system work naturally
- **Multiple containers:** Easily switch between isolated project environments
- **Persistent settings:** Extensions and preferences are saved per container

### Docker Only (No VS Code)

If you prefer to run without VS Code Remote Containers:

**Using docker-compose:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Add your API key to .env
docker-compose up
```

**Or build and run manually:**
```bash
docker build -t opencode-dev .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace opencode-dev
```

## 💾 Session Management

OpenCode sessions allow you to save and resume conversations. Use the `run` script to manage sessions:

> **Note:** Inside the container, `run` is installed to `/usr/local/bin/` and available in your PATH. Use `run` (without `./`) from any directory. If running outside the container, use `./run` from the project directory.

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `run new [name]` | Start a new session (optionally named) |
| `run resume <name>` | Resume a saved session |
| `run list` | List all saved sessions |
| `run delete <name>` | Delete a session |

### Examples

```bash
# Start a new session with auto-generated name
run new

# Start a named session for a specific feature
run new user-authentication

# Resume working on a previous session
run resume user-authentication

# View all your saved sessions
run list

# Delete an old session
run delete old-feature
```

Sessions are stored in `.opencode-sessions/` directory and persist across container restarts.

For detailed session management, see the [Session Management Guide](./docs/SESSIONS.md).
